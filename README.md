# Overview
This repository contains a boilerplate for those wishing to build a custom docker image for the [ObjectNet Challenge](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/726/overview). It assumes you have a custom model which you intend to submit for evaluation to the ObjectNet Challenge.

If your model is built using PyTorch, a more comprehensive docker template along with instructions can be found at [Creating your Docker image from the PyTorch template](https://abarbu.github.io/objectnet-challenge-doc-ibm-dev/dockerfile-from-template.html).

If you are not familiar with docker here are instructions on how to [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/), along with a [quick start guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

To use this example see Section 2.5 of the [ObjectNet Challenge submission instructions](https://abarbu.github.io/objectnet-challenge-doc-ibm-dev/dockerfile-from-scratch.html)
